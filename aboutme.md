1. The slit in my eyebrow is not done on purpose to make me look cool. It’s actually a scar. I snook into my mums bed when I was 3/4 years old, she didn’t know I was there, rolled over and I fell out and cracked my head open on the side dresser. <br><br>
2. I can play 7 instruments if you count the recorder. Although i don’t play regularly anymore so really am only proficient in the saxophone. But with a few days practice and sheet music I can get back up to speed. In order of proficiency... Saxophone, Recorder, Clarinet, Piano, Flute, Bagpipes, Drums. I do not like to play in front of people, I used to play in a band but I hated it. So don’t ask me to play it won’t happen. <br><br>
3. When I was 15 I got my first female partner, who was quite a bit older than me. I did not date men again until I was 18. Then it was on and off for many years. Now I have lost all interest in anyone. <br><br>
4. I have PCOS, although it does not affect my life hardly I do worry about the potential of not being able to mother a child quite a lot. I also do believe that my hormone imbalance has a lot to do with my life choices and personality traits, and that my excess testosterone has a huge impact on a lot of things.<br><br>
5. I had a Pilonidal Sinus back in 2016 and now have a wonky bum crack. <br><br>
6. I have slight trust/abandonment (some would say daddy) issues. Which I think might be the underlying reason why I have a guard up so much, it takes a while for me to want to befriend someone and why I don’t want a relationship. <br><br>
7. I have names for my first child, whether it be a boy or a girl. Dennis or Esther. <br><br>
8. I have a really small forehead, which I used to dislike so much I used to shave it. Now not so bothered but it’s rare you’ll see me with my hair slapped back. If ever. <br><br>
9. I don’t eat pork, and absolutely love pigs. But I stopped telling people about it because there’s only so many pig money banks, ornaments and gifts a girl can own. <br><br>
10. I have far too many drunken stories to ever want to write them all on this blog. But here’s 3... I once nearly slept with a midget but freaked out last minute and kicked them out. I have hitch hiked in a lorry because I got lost trying to get home. I once took myself to my mums house because I was adamant that I was home, she was not happy. <br><br>
11. I have a birth mark under my boobs which when I get hot shows up and kind of looks like Africa (well I think it does) <br><br>
12. I have a really addictive personality and find it really hard to overcome. Whether it’s biting my nails, smoking or coffee. <br><br>
13. I’m a huge home bird, when I go away for even a long weekend I get homesick. I love to see new places but I’m not one for travelling and don’t think I’d ever do it properly. A week away is too much even in the most beautiful of settings. <br><br>
14. I spent 3 years getting my Alevels because I found women, alcohol and drugs. I don’t regret this though and feel my life turned out so much better for it because I wouldn’t have met the best people in my life had I not messed around. <br><br>
15. I’m definitely a jack of all trades master of none. And I don’t intend to ever be a master in anything because I have no desire and I have the attention span of a goldfish. However, I do have lots of random obsessions that I immerse myself into (albeit sometimes for not very long, as I lose interest very quickly). Currently I’m into finances, the ecomony, permaculture, minimalism and cooking. This will change though. <br><br>
16. I struggle to read fiction because I don’t have a very good visual imagination, and no matter how descriptive a book is I cannot picture any of it. Therefore I find it quite hard to get into and struggle to keep up. Mix that with my shitty memory and by chapter 2 I’ve forgotten what I’m reading. I would say the only book I’ve truly enjoyed all the way through is The Pillars of The Earth. <br><br>
17. I once died my hair bright ginger. <br><br>
18. I at one point had 12 piercings. I now have 7 including ear lobes which imo don’t really count. I have no tattoos because I’m a wuss and cry at a Chinese burn. <br><br>
19. I’ve never broken a bone or had any serious injuries. The most pain I’ve ever been in was being punched in the face because I was mouthing off at a bloke outside a nightclub. I lost all dignity when I got punched and instantly cried like a little girl. I’m not as tough as my exterior would suggest. <br><br>
20. I’m not very flexible, I cannot do a Roly Poly or touch my toes standing up. <br><br>
21. I once was a professional cleaner. Not that you can tell because I hate cleaning and my house is always a shit tip. My little brother likes to remind me off this regularly.<br><br>
22. My favourite job of all time was working behind a bar. I loved it. I’ve worked in lots and lots of bars and have never disliked any of them. If only it paid well and the hours weren’t so bad. <br><br>
23. I have one leg longer than the other. <br><br>
24. I have an awful lot of acquaintances in my life, but there’s only a few I would actually call friends. <br><br>
25. I have to get 8 hours sleep a night or my body shuts off and sleeps through everything. <br><br>
26. Im not a strong swimmer, I nearly drowned twice as a child and although I can swim an acceptable amount you won’t catch me jumping in the deep end or into the sea. <br><br>
27. I’m a very independent woman and do everything myself, however I am far more motivated with someone else around, when alone it does take me a while to get up and go hence why it took 13 months to finish my kitchen. But I did fit my own kitchen, so time is irrelevant to me.<br><br>
28. I don’t have a favourite colour, song, tv show etc. I guess I just love everything so much I don’t feel like I can pick favourites. <br><br>
29. My face speaks before my mouth does, or when I don’t want my mouth to; no matter how hard I try to stop it. I cannot lie nor can I hide anything because of this. <br><br>
30. I don’t believe in soul mates, souls, life after death, ghosts, spirits or anything like that. I believe we are a living organism just like anything else on this planet and once our organs die we die. However, I do believe that peoples personalities are made up of brain muscle memory and in turn that should a brain be put into another body you would still be that person in all aspects other than appearance. But once the brain died you die and you decay into the ground the same way another animal or a plant would. <br><br>
31. I absolutely hate small talk. <br><br>
