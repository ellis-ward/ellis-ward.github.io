title: About me
subtitle:  So during our Rona quiz I said a few things about me that my friends didn’t seem to have a clue about. Due to this I have decided to add a  random things about me to this page. My memory is awful, so I will add to this as I remember things, or new things happen. But here’s a brief insight into me.

1. The slit in my eyebrow is not done on purpose to make me look cool. It’s actually a scar. I snook into my mums bed when I was 3/4 years old, she didn’t know I was there, rolled over and I fell out and cracked my head open on the side dresser. <br><br>
2. I can play 7 instruments if you count the recorder. Although i don’t play regularly anymore so really am only proficient in the saxophone. But with a few days practice and sheet music I can get back up to speed. In order of proficiency... Saxophone, Recorder, Clarinet, Piano, Flute, Bagpipes, Drums. I do not like to play in front of people, I used to play in a band but I hated it. So don’t ask me to play it won’t happen. <br><br>
3. When I was 15 I got my first female partner, who was quite a bit older than me. I did not date men again until I was 18. Then it was on and off for many years. Now I have lost all interest in anyone. <br><br>
4. I have PCOS, although it does not affect my life hardly I do worry about the potential of not being able to mother a child quite a lot. <br><br>
5. I had a Pilonidal Sinus back in 2016 and now have a wonky bum crack. <br><br>
6. I have slight trust/abandonment (some would say daddy) issues. Which I think might be the underlying reason why I have a guard up so much, it takes a while for me to want to befriend someone and why I don’t want a relationship. <br><br>
7. I have names for my first child, whether it be a boy or a girl. Dennis or Esther. <br><br>
8. I have a really small forehead, which I used to dislike so much I used to shave it. Now not so bothered but it’s rare you’ll see me with my hair slapped back. If ever. <br><br>
9. I don’t eat pork, and absolutely love pigs. But I stopped telling people about it because there’s only so many pig money banks, ornaments and gifts a girl can own. <br><br>
10. I have far too many drunken stories to ever want to write them all on this blog. But here’s 3... I once nearly slept with a midget but freaked out last minute and kicked them out. I have hitch hiked in a lorry because I got lost trying to get home. I once took myself to my mums house because I was adamant that I was home, she was not happy. <br><br>
11. I have a birth mark under my boobs which when I get hot shows up and kind of looks like Africa (well I think it does) <br><br>
12. I have a really addictive personality and find it really hard to overcome. Whether it’s biting my nails, smoking or coffee. <br><br>
13. I’m a huge home bird, when I go away for even a long weekend I get homesick. I love to see new places but I’m not one for travelling and don’t think I’d ever do it properly. A week away is too much even in the most beautiful of settings. <br><br>
14. I spent 3 years getting my Alevels because I found a women, alcohol and drugs. I don’t regret this though and feel my life turned out so much better for it because I wouldn’t have met the best people in my life had I not messed around. <br><br>
15. I’m definitely a jack of all trades master of none. And I don’t intent to ever be a master in anything because I have the attention span of a goldfish. However, I do have lots of random obsessions that I immerse myself into (albeit sometimes for not very long, as I lose interest very quickly). Currently I’m into finances, gardening and cooking. This will change though. <br><br>
16. I struggle to read fiction because I don’t have a very good visual imagination, and no matter how descriptive a book is I cannot picture any of it. Therefore I find it quite hard to get into and struggle to keep up. Mix that with my shitty memory and by chapter 2 I’ve forgotten what I’m reading. I would say the only book I’ve truly enjoyed all the way through is The Pillars of The Earth. <br><br>
17. I once died my hair bright ginger. <br><br>
18. I at one point had 12 piercings. I now have 7 including ear lobes which imo don’t really count. I have no tattoos because I’m a wuss and cry at a Chinese burn. <br><br>
19. I’ve never broken a bone or had any serious injuries. The most pain I’ve ever been in was being punched in the face because I was mouthing off at a bloke outside a nightclub. I lost all dignity when I got punched and instantly cried like a little girl. I’m not as tough as my exterior would suggest. <br><br>
20. I’m not very flexible, I cannot do a Roly Poly or touch my toes standing up. <br><br>
