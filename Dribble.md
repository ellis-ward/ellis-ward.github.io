Ellis' dribble
 #1 <br>
I have a slight problem where by I like to come with ideas, life ventures or projects (whatever takesmy fancy on any given day), which I start, but never finish. <br>
A few examples <br>
A kitchen I started 5 months ago and still haven't finished,<br>
Programming school, which started in May'17. I gave up on that after failing to do my homework and falling out with the teacher(my brother) because I didn't turn up. I fell asleep.<br>
A furniture restoration business I started in 2018, it's now 6 months in I've bought a circa Â£800 shed, lotsof furniture and only sold one item. Going well I think.<br>
A house I've been in a year next month and have only completed one room.<br>
A puppy I've owned for now 9 months, I think she's training me as much as I am her!<br>
To name a few.<br>
My latest two are a financial diet I have just started, and perusing the life of a blogger.<br>
Well get to the other one, but I am now a blogger, so let's talk about that. My brother showed his face today, in hand a beautiful website for his new blog. I am impressed. This has of course made me want to write my own blog. One problem, I didn't go to programming school, so I have no idea how to make myself a website.... So obviously I used my charm and asked my big brother if he'd make me a website. He said no. Well not no in so many words, he told me if I wrote something, and proved I was actually going to stick to this he'd help me. Makes sense, why would he invest his valuable time helping his baby sister you ask, maybe because he has faith in me and wants to help me persue my latest dream. Clearly not. So here I am, writing my first page of my blog. *He does have little faith in me in many ways, he told me I couldn't bring a date to his wedding because my relationshipsneverlastandthere'dbephotosofarandomathiswedding. Hewasright,Ibroughtsomeone even though he said no, and two months later I was single again. That's another thing I don't follow through with. <br>
 
So, blog. I have had a long hard think about subjects I would like to write about: - My DIY ventures<br>
- Misty and I training each other<br>
- Me learning to program (I'll start school again)<br>
- My new financial diet<br>
But I decided hell with a topic, I'm just going to write about myself. There's enough to go at! And if it's not interesting and no one reads it, at least it's somewhere to rant so that I stop talking to my dog about everything, going stir crazy and talking literally at my family my family for hours on end when ever I see them. Joys of being a spinster. Plus, you can have a good laugh at my expense.<br>
So this is my digital, dribble list.<br>
Bit of context: quite some years ago now my brother, the same brother who has no faith, started keeping a dribble book of all the stupid stuff I do and say. It's not a family tradition to get this out and read quotes (dribbles) I've said and taking to mick out of me. Most statementsare ludicrous and do make me cackle when they're read back to me.<br>
So , I'm going to carry on the dribble book here. As we all live separately now most of my dribbles go wasted on my dog.<br>
I'll just say one thing. I am not a moron, I am an educated woman, honestly. Remember that.<br>
