Recently I heard about the idea of sharing your work on the internet, as a way to share your experiences, opinions and lessons learnt with other people. 
This is meant to be a brilliant way to grow as a person but also to help others who want to learn what you're learning along with you. 
So, I'm going to give this a go. There's going to be no specific topic to this section of my blog, as I will be talking about my work as the definition that most people know it as being the 9-5 day job that I am paid for but also my work in regards to hobbies, side-hustles, and basically anything I have learnt about that I think will add value to me and others by sharing.
