I really like MySpace. I think it was revolutionary in all social media. People with no creativity or aptitude used Bebo, and all the creative souls used MySpace. Now every man and his dog uses facebook, even the ones that think they’re cool and quirky with a twitter account still; they’re all on Facebook. <br><br>
But MySpace taught the 90’s kids how to use HTML, and in turn the basics of the magic internet. Although 60% of us just googled tutorials, copied code, altered the colours and removed the credited author; we thought we were professional web designers. And we nailed it! <br><br> 
We all went through phases, where we altered our profile to the current trends and spent hours researching basic HTML to make ourselves look cool to our peers. We dedicated our lives to ensuring we did not fall behind. When the trend changed and it was the in thing to make your profile as simple and boring as possible, so it looked like you were trying to hard, we were all still trying way too hard to do that. Because your page didn’t update itself <br><br> 
I whole heartily believe that MySpace was great. <br> We should be educated about how websites function behind the exterior, how apps are created and the hard work that goes into making the internet the amazing thing it is today. <br><br> 
Bring back MySpace.
