Mum ordered two IBCs (intermediate bulk containers) off of EBay for Â£15 each, which was a bargain. These containers we collected from a business which had cleaned them and repurposed them for use of water, so we paid for the them and delivered them to the allotment. That evening we had a phone call from the lady who runs the allotment telling us we could not have the IBCs on her allotment because they would contaminate the soil and it was not acceptable. After explaining <b> nicely </b> that the containers had been cleaned by a repitable company and that they were safe to use, if they were not we would not want to water our own food with them, mum managed to convince her that they were ok to stay but we would have to check the water coming out was clean. Needless to say slightly frustrated, as when we walked around the allotment there were others that were colour stained; I personally think that it was just because they're on the entrance into the allotment and aren't as pretty as a brand new one. So we have ordered two covers from AliExpress, it will take months for them to come but we have no rain yet and when they do we'll make them look prettier because that's obviously an issue... Maybe our allotment adventure will be over before we know it, we don't do well with politics and being told what to do.<br><br>

On a more positive note though we do have our first courgette sprouting, have made some netting covers for our brassicae and our tomato plants are starting to flower. Into the end of spring and nearly 2 weeks into our allotment adventure and we're starting to see some signs of fruits and vegetables coming our way, which is very exciting!<br><br>

We also got some free onions from our allotmenteer neighbour, plus all the advice on when to plant them how to plant them and what to do with them when they've grown. Followed by praise when I was planting them that I was doing it right. I think he might be our new allotment grandad. Although, I don't mind a bit of advice, praise and absolutely don't mind a freebie! So no complaints over here.<br><br>

We now are growing:<br>
*Day12 onions <br>
*Day10 cauliflower, spring onion, lettuce, pak choi, edible flower mix, ornamentals<br> 
*Day3 tomatoes, potatoes, kale, brocolli, courgette <br>
*Day2 blueberries, cranberries, rasberries, whiteberries, cabbage, onion<br>
*Day1 runner beans, rhubarb <br><br>

Also, side point... Mums got a little lazy by this point and is watering the bigger plants with buckets rather than watering cans. It's doing the trick though I suppose.<br>
