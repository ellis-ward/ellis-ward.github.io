We're definitely experimenting this weekend. The forecast shows negative temperatures at least 4 times within the next week, which would be fine if we had been 
patient... but we weren't... we planted 22 different types of seeds over 2 weeks ago in an unheated greenhouse. <br><br>
Why not?!<br><br>
Well that's what we told ourselves back in March, knowing we could still get frosts in the middle of the UK up until the end of April for definite, but hoping that 
we wouldn't, of course. <br>We're now expecting negative 1 to 2 degrees celcius and are unsure what to do. <br><br>

If we don't water the babies they will die, if we do water them they could also die and our trusted friend Google likes to give contradicting advice; so we've gone 
with the "lets water and hope it doesn't freeze" method!

I'll with with a few photos of our baby plants, incase they don't survive the frost! And if they do, then our winging it worked and you're welcome to take it as 
proven advice that not following all the rules of the garden can work favourably! Plants want to grow, not die, at the end of the day.
