I haven't posted in a while because my lockdown has actually been pretty busy the over the last couple of weeks. I have been meaning to and have a lot of dribbles drafted in my notes as well but I just keep turning my computer on and then getting distracted with other things and not getting around to it. So here's an update on what we've been up to over the last 17 days. <br><br>

We have finally had a harvest. 35 days after starting our journey, with nothing in the ground apart from weeds, we have harvested 5 raspberries. They were very nice and of course we ate them on the allotment. It's pretty rewarding and definitely gives a sense of pride being able to pick off our first produce as getting an allotment so far after the last frost makes things a little bit difficult and of course we're not seeing anywhere as much progress as other allotmenteers but we'll get there. This just shows it.

A trip was taken to B&Q, where we queued for an hour in the scorching heat (never ever again will I do that!) to purchase some compost and paint for my spare room. We left with a Â£100 polytunnel. Because why not! <br><br>

Since, we have planted carrots, peas, lettuce, herbs and spring onions in said polytunnel in the hope that we can extend our short growing window. <br> <br>

We've also laid some slabs infront of our shed (well Lewis did most of the work and we just got in the way really)<br><br>  

NB: Our little garden has come a long way in the last week and the majority of these photos are from a week ago, so I will update on that!<br><br>

We now are growing:<br>
*Day26 chantenay red cored carrots, mangetout peas, little gem lettuce, basil, parsley, white lisbon spring onions <br>
*Day12 onions <br>
*Day10 cauliflower, spring onion, red salad bowl lettuce, pak choi, edible flower mix, ornamentals<br> 
*Day3 tomatoes, potatoes, kale, brocolli, courgette <br>
*Day2 blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, whiteberries, cabbage, onion<br>
