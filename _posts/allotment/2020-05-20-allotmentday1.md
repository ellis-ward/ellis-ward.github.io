It’s off to a flying start! I was up early raring to go with a flask of coffee, a sandwich and my tools in hand. <br> 
Today is the day to de-weed the plot and get it ready for planting. I mean, we don’t have a shed, a good source of water or any shade from the scorching 26° sun... but we’re going to get stuck in and least make it look like we know what we’re doing. <br> <br> Mums packed up our festival trolley full of tools, weed bags and chairs to wheel down to the allotments with the intention of getting all the weeding done and on to the more exciting jobs! <br><br> 

We succeeded in weeding the plot. Three ladies and the sun to egg us on we manage to fill all our weed bags and completely clear the lot! All went well and no hiccups... Other than an aching mother, and burnt Charlotte and myself with a blister because I was using a fork that my dog had previously chewed so it was digging into my hands. <br><br> 

Then started the walk home, trolley filled with all the weeds to put in my compost bin back at home (because of course we haven’t got a compost bin on the pitch yet either), bellies full of food and full of pride with what we’d achieved. <br><br> But of course we can not have a successful day with nothing going wrong, that's just not something that happens in my life. Our fabulous festival trolley decided to give way! Right outside of asda on the main road. The wheels buckle underneath, it toppled and we’re all stood there covered in sweat stranded outside asda with the a broken trolley full of weeds, tools and bags. <br><br>Needless to say we were a site. We managed to drag the broken trolley to the adsa delivery entrance where me and Charlotte set up camp and waited for mum to walk home to get a car. People in cars staring at us, waving at us and laughing. It’s almost like they’d never seen two sweaty ladies waiting by the side of a main road with a broken trolley full of weeds before. Oh yea, and I did get my beach chair out to sit on whilst we waited.<br>

A good start to our allotment adventure ended by embarrassment and a broken trolley. But we did it. We weeded the whole plot in four hours, and I myself got a glorious tan to go along with it. So all is going okay so far!
