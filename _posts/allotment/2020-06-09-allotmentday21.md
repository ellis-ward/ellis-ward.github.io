Todays plan was to go down to the allotment, hill up our potatoes, do some weeding and water whilst we waited for our shed delivery. <br>
The plan was for an early morning start, but I got a phone call in the morning from the mother saying the delivery had been postponed until 12 O'Clock. So I sat and watched some YouTube whilst I waited. At 12 O'Clock we drove down the allotment with all our belongings ready to go in the shed, we began to potter around doing odd jobs whilst we waited, had our packed lunch, drank some coffee, had a few fags, and kept ourselves busy. <br><br>

We got a text at 12 O'Clock saying they were running late and would be another 1-2 hours. Lucky in this time we had been told by another allotmenteer that they were in fact leaving and if there was anything inside their old polytunnel we wanted we could help ourselves (so the additional wait time wasn't a problem)! <br><br> 

Well, we love a bargain so we went for a rummage. <br>Ended up with some plant pots, canes, shelves, a side table, a seed cover and some wooden crates! <br>So we carried our freebies back to our allotment feeling very happy and proud of ourselves.<br><br> 

Another 2 hours later... finally... the shed is here! (By this point we're fed up, want to go home and are very tired. We've done everything we possibly could and had run out of jobs to do)<br><br>

Shed was assembled by 6pm, lots of objects painted, sign hung, shed filled, tummies full and very very tired. I think for this post my photos will speak more than I will as my brain is half asleep. I'm sat making seed envelopes right now because it's crafty and I don't have to think.
