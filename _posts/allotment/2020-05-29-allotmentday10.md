I wasn't going to do another allotment blog post until our shed got delivered because really all we have been doing is watering and prepping. So nothing really to update on. However, today was pretty eventful and we do have some interesting things that are happening.<br><br>

As the subtitle of this post suggests we experienced another episode of being stranded at our allotment. This is twice now and we're only on day 10. Not having much luck. We drove down in the car early afternoon in the attempt to get some bargain compost from asda, queued for what felt like forever in the scorching sun only to find that it had all gone. Not a bag left on site. This was extremely disappointing, because they had put the compost inside due to Rona we couldn't see and had to queue before we knew if there was any or not. So we grabbed a couple of tomato grow bags instead, not as cheap but still compost full on nutrients so it will do the job, I suppose. We went to the allotment and started planting up our flower starts and some seeds. <br><br>

We now are growing:<br>
*Day10 cauliflower, beetroot, lettuce, pak choi<br> 
*Day3 tomatoes, potatoes, kale, brocolli, courgette <br>
*Day2 blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, whiteberries, cabbage, onion<br>
*Day1 runner beans, rhubarb <br><br>

Prep is going well, we are slowly working our soil on a budget to reduce cost of course, recycled some of Lewis' pop cans to deter the birds and protect our eyes from being gouged out, relocated some old planters for our flower and herb garden, staked our tomatoes and covered our cabbage. Along with some little fruits starting on the berry bushes. And a bottle of champers drunk to toast mums beloved departed friend. <br><br>

We have also noticed a few baby brocolli showing their heads. Which is absolutely lovely to see. Well, they may actually be weeds but we're holding hopeful that they are brocolli been as they are showing up along our strip in an even spread where we did plant seeds and germination of brocolli is approximately 7 days so this is entirely possible. So fingers crossed with this one. As we're not very knowledgeable about what our veggies look like until they're the size of a plant start we are guessing right now.<br><br>

Anyway, we go to head home and mum turns the key in her car, only to find that it will not start and is making some weird kind of ticking rather than trying to turn over. Potentially electrical fault I fear. Stranded at the allotment we decided we would abandon the car and let her partner look at it in the morning, but I had bought beer and mixers for my socially distant garden visit from my baby bro (thank you Bojo for letting this one happen)! Luckily I had a reusable tote in my bum bag, thank you sustainable thinking! With bag full of beer and mixers we stumbled back home, pouring with sweat and shoes squelching because I wore flip flops not thinking and got myself covered in water and mud. <br><br>

Another day at the allotment, another disaster and another day in my life where Lewis can say "Ellis you're so embarrassing", but successful and rewarding all the same.
