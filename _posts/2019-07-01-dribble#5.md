Over the last couple of months myself and the mother have been working on our new business venture. More for her and her retirement, but also a way of keeping myself occupied, to the expense of my ever growing list of jobs. <br><br>
As I'm sure everyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly an avid social media user, so when it's come to promoting products on Instagram and Facebook I have had to do a lot of research to understand how to best utilise things like hash-tags and groups. I think I'm getting there, slowly. <br><br>

Although this has been great fun for me, and I'm enjoying every minute of it, it has meant that everything else has taken a back burner in my life. To be honest it's not really like me, I normally start something and then half way through get side tracked and end up with lots and lots of half finished projects... I have an list of jobs as long as my body, which I just keep ignoring because they're no where near as fun as learning how to create a website. <br><br>
<i>Although, this has meant that I haven't been blogging... Which I guess everyone knew would happen anyway! So nothing new to report. </i>
