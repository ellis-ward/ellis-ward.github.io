I haven't writted about lock down at all in my blog because to be honest it's been pretty okay for me. Well to a point. Actually probably not, I think I have maybe been lying to myself. Well it has been absolutely fine another than my initial fear of the outside world and my lack of motivation. <br><br>

I had planned on doing a seperate section in my blog for lockdown and documenting my journey, but to be honest I haven't done anything exciting well at least not until May when we got our allotment; so I've had no need to really and it probably would have been a pretty boring read. I have spent a lot of time talking to myself when on dog walks, which I suppose would be exceptional dribbles if they had been recorded but to be honest I don't think I'm brave enough to post my isolation rants; I may be an extrovert but that's going to another level.<br><br>

So, for the first month of official lockdown I refused to see anyone and got aggy with my family if they even mentioned leaving the house or them doing things they shouldn't be. I was certain that my Asthma and PCOS would be the end of me and under no circumstance was I risking it. I think I might have accidently shielded myself without even realising it.<br><br>

But I have been at home now, isolated from the world, for 74 days. It feels like forever but also like it's flew by all at the same time. I got sent home from work on the 19/03/2020 and was stood down (furloughed) on the 26/03/2020. Not all of this time has been me cooped up refusing to see anyone or do anything, Rona has kept me kind of busy, albeit not as busy as I should have been with 74 days at home. But I definitely have thanked the break from the 8-5 life, and am absolutely 100% enjoying my mid-life retirement. During this time I have:<br><br>
 - Tried to quit smoking and failed,<br>
 - Tried to stop biting my nails and failed,<br>
 - Lots and lots of walks and phone calls and visits from my baby bro, he's kept me strong during this whole thing, definite rock <br>
 - Many leftover delivered, visits and walks thank you mother for not allowing me to hit rock bottom<br>
 - Done a bit of DIY, new curtains, bedroom stripped back to basics, garden re-arranged and pottered, outdoor tap installed<br>
 - Drive bys to wave from a distance because we missed each other<br>
 - Killed my car battery, Lewis fixed it!<br>
 - Done lots of baking / cooking / eating healthy<br>
 - Too many quizes<br>
 - Discord Rona D&D<br>
 - Lost a bit of weight but toned massively<br>
 - Lots of pictures of animals receieved from my friends farm (absolutely adorable and a definite mood booster)<br>
 - Many a group chat with friends / family / babies / pets<br>
 - Long and relaxing walks in the country<br>
 - Food delivered to me (I could get used to that bit) <br>
 - Allotment gained<br>
 - A few tears had<br>
 - Visited my friends and their baby for her 1st birthday<br>
 - Walked to my grandmas for a garden visit <br>
 - Just a couple of arguements, mainly because of my aggy mood<br>
 - Cut my hair off for charity<br>
 - VE day celibrated on my front drive with scones, cakes, buntin, and drinks<br>
 - A couple of walks with my big bro and my neice<br>
 - I've applied for voluntary redunancy and have a new job to start in July<br>
 - Tried all the trends, as you do... Joe Wicks, baking, TikTok. I've done it all.<br><br>

Not really anything worth writing about, although it has been an interesting journey to say the least; and definitely something none of us will forget. <br><br>

June is the month. With only 1 month left before I'm back at work full time, and lots of others going back to work today, I cannot sit and waste this month, plus it's the month I will be turning 27. So I will be trying my upmost to get up and going and get that spare room done! <br><br>

I'm not looking forward to going back to the grind, and have grown to like pottering around doing my own thing all day. But a new job, a new start and a new adventure is exciting all the same.
