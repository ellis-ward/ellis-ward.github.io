      On June 6th I made 69 commits to this website, for which my brother told me off. <br/>Apparently I should be making all my changes locally, trialling them and then committing when I’m happy with all the changes. <br/>In theory I agree, but my life motto is #justdoit... plus, when I’m walking the dog and an idea comes into my head if I don’t make the change there and then I <u> will </u> forget! <br/><br/>

Oh, and that I make all my commits without leaving any notes about what I’ve done and why. <br/>That’s mainly because I’m lazy, but also because I don’t actually know what I’m doing and I’m making it up as I go along. <br/><br/>

Story of my life. 
Fake it ‘til you make it.
