Recently I met the most amazing woman - she’s far too kind for me, far too generous for me and far too good looking for me. And for some reason, she wants to marry me.<br><br>

It all started with a “How are you? You look well”<br><br>
Hours of conversations, lots of giggles, and a few swear words (from my mouth) later I’m happy to say that this lady has decided that despite my grumps, tight arseness and old man like personality she’s ok with sticking around.<br><br>

We’re 27 days into our engagement and planning a wedding is already making me go grey, so I hope you’re all ready for the “I wish I’d have known this before we got married” post later on! I’m currently keeping a secret blog of it all so it should be a good read.<br><br>

Anyway, we were on about Yssi not wedding planning….<br><br>

It’s so wonderful to have someone to calm me down from my chaotic life, and help me with my million and one projects. She’s helped me move Jack and Sparrow in, evict rats, decorate the bedrooms and bathroom, build a border on the front drive and put up shelves to name a few. But also, adding lots of personality to the house, I mean I didn’t know it was missing before but the amount of people that have commented would suggest it was (maybe it’s that she <i>actually</i> cleans it)! <br><br>

To a lot of people, including my mother, this is a <b>huge</b> shock to the system. I have for many many many years been single, but by choice. I had planned the rest of my life out as a spinster, I was going to raise my own children, and be completely independent. Mainly because I don’t like 99% of the human population, but also because I’m extremely selfish when it comes to my life and I also don’t trust people. <br><br>

But anyway, Yssi has managed to crack that hard exterior and now that I have finally let someone in; I’m very happy about it. <br><br>
It helps that she is happy with me still being independent, selfish and miserable. Who'd want me any other way!
