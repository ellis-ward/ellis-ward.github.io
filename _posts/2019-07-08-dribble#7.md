Gone are the days of Misty running around the fields! <br><br>
This morning we got half way down the field and she turned around and bolted in the opposite direction. <br>
Something <b> must </b> have spooked her because she didn’t even look back. She just ran until she got to the end and then stood there with her tail between her legs waiting for me to catch up. <br>
<br>
How did I end up with a dog that’s scared of her own shadow. I did everything I should have, took her to training, socialised her with people and animals, took her to public places and exercised her regularly.<br>
Anyone would think she’s come from an abusive home, but no she’s just a whimp. <br><br>
<br>
Hoover left out she cries.<br>
Toys out of reach she cries.<br>
Someone comes to the door she doesn’t know she barks.<br>
Someone comes to the door she does know she cries excessively and wees so much that Alex now says he’s “milking the dog”.<br>
A noise in the night she cries.<br>
God help me if I try and bathe her!
