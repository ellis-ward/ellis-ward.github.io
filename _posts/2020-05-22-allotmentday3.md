We hadn't planned to do anything to our allotment today. We've both spent hours and hours sifting through EBay, Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace etc. to find a shed and water butt because we're getting fed up of walking to the water tap constantly. But no joy. So we weren't going to do any more planting today. <br><br>

However! Grandma had dropped off some chitting seed potatoes that she'd bought from somewhere. God knows where, at 80 she is meant to be isolating and not going out for unnecessary trips, but apparently that doesn't apply to her. Albeit useful for us as we now have some potatoes. A friend of mine from work also very kindly donated me 6 tomato plants and kale plants. So, they needed planting or it would have been a wasted gift that we killed. <br><br>

So day 3 and off we go back down to the allotment, trolley full and ready to dig and water. Oh, mum also arrived at my house with rubbish in the trolley for my black bin, because hers was too full and it all blew over the street. Best not forget that! Woops. <br><br>

We now are growing:<br>
*Day3 tomatoes, potatoes, kale, brocolli, aubergine <br>
*Day2 blueberries, cranberries, rasberries, whiteberries, cabbage, onion<br>
*Day1 runner beans, rhubarb <br><br>

I also got another peice of friendly advise off another allotmenteer. Get a shed but don't buy a cheap one because apparently it's the best investment and his was a labour of love if I want to go and have a look at it. Needless to say I haven't. AND he also decided to critique my sign and tell me that "Gaynor and Ellis'" is not grammatically correct and that it should have an "s" on the end. I just did my fake laugh and said we'll have to agree to disgree, because I didn't want to look like a wolly if I trully was wrong. I then couldn't let it drop so asked my super sister in law and big bro and I was right, of course! I won't forget to tell him. <br><br>

Oh and apparently mum got fed up of waiting and has ordered a shed... I cannot elaborate on this though as that's all I know.
