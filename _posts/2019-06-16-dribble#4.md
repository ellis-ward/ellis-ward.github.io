In the 21st Century dating has become so exhausting, that it’s a full time job to keep up. <br><br>
There’s so many dating platforms that you get lost in a sea of profiles.<br><br>
Not only do we have dating apps like <a href="https://tinder.com/?lang=en-GB">tinder</a> and <a href="https://bumble.com/">bumble</a> (and the other 5k I haven’t tried out), but we’re also expected to use our personal accounts like <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en">instagram</a> & <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">whatsapp</a>. Which I 100% cannot get used to, and don’t think I want to. Never mind the copious amounts of paid dating websites <a href="https://www.pof.com/">plenty of fish</a>, <a href="https://www.friendsreuniteddating.com/">friends reunited</a> etc. <br><br>
What happened to the good old days where you met someone through friends, bumped into them in a store or on a night out? <br><br>
So the other day I get a facebook message, from someone I haven’t spoken to in 5 years. A horny devil face. What even is that all about? Just bore off mate. Not to mention the messages on instagram from creepy men asking for a fuck or a “what’s up beautiful”, I don’t even  post any photos of myself on instagram and the photos of me on my facebook aren’t ever of my best self; so why would anyone think I’m on there to meet people and hook up. <br><br>
And on dating apps: <br>
It’s like we’re too dedicated to keeping our profiles up to date and ensuring we’re not ignoring the fitties we’ve matched that we completely miss the opportunity to have an actual conversation with a real human being that might actually, god forbid, want to talk to you and not just bash and dash. <br>
‘For a friend’ I did purchase tinder gold for a month, purely for research purposes of course, and I can’t even… So I paid £13.99 for a month subscription and I got to see all the people who have swiped right on you. That sounds good. <b> No </b>! After a day I had circa 2k people to sift through, 80% of which don’t respond when I talk to them because they’ve just played tinder roulette and didn’t fancy me in the first place, 19% just want a fuck and nothing more and the 1% that do want to date me take so long to find that by the time I've found them and actually start talking to them I’m fed up of the rigmarole that I really just want to delete the app and go out. <br>
Plus the added confusion that with tinder gold I don’t know if I'm matching them because they’re my type, or just because they've swiped me and I'm curious. Which never goes down well becaust I get bored and ghost after 5 minutes<br><br>
I think I’m just going to admit my fate and begin my life of a lonely spinster now,  save all the hassle.
