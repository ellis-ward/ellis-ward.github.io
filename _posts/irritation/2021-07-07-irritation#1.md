To Ellis’ annoyance we are now apparently exercising. Anyone that knows me knows that I do not exercise and have not broken a sweat in almost 9 years. This being because I am, when it comes to my physical health, the laziest person I know. Literally. To anyone that missed it here is a clip from a video I posted back in May 2020 which summarises this exact blog post perfectly.

So, anyway, we’re exercising (I think!)<br>
<br>
We’re 2 days in now and so far I’ve done a few sit up and push ups and then skipped a day <i> already </i>. Which kind of would suggest that this is going to go well! But I’m going to stick at it, and see if Yssi and I can end up with trim bods. Anything is possible right?  
<br><br>
I mean, in Yssis beautiful plan (let’s all appreciate her efforts here) we are <i>apparently</i> doing 50 sit ups, 40 push ups, 10 reps of weights and 40 squats. Erm…. I’m not sure about that!
