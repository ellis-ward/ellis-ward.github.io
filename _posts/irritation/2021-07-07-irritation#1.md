To Ellisâ€™ annoyance we are now apparently exercising. Anyone that knows me knows that I do not exercise and have not broken a sweat in almost 9 years. This being because I am, when it comes to my physical health, the laziest person I know. Literally. To anyone that missed it here is a clip from a video I posted back in May 2020 which summarises this exact blog post perfectly.

    <p>Ok, so Calum James Ironside decided it would be hilarious to nominate me for the #25pushupchallenge... 

As I am physically not capable of doing a push-up, nor do i have the ability to maintain a straight back or good arm position I shall do this once and only once. Or I will end up hurting myself ðŸ˜‚ 

So here is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you to see me fail at working out, all in the good spirit of spreading awareness for mental health.

I hope this brought a smile to some faces and if anyone is struggling you know where I am. ðŸ˜˜</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ellis.ward.161">Ellis Ward</a> on Saturday, 23 May 2020</blockquote></div> 
   
 
So, anyway, weâ€™re exercising (I think!)<br>
<br>
Weâ€™re 2 days in now and so far Iâ€™ve done a few sit up and push ups and then skipped a day <i> already </i>. Which kind of would suggest that this is going to go well! But Iâ€™m going to stick at it, and see if Yssi and I can end up with trim bods. Anything is possible right?  
<br><br>
I mean, in Yssis beautiful plan (letâ€™s all appreciate her efforts here) we are <i>apparently</i> doing 50 sit ups, 40 push ups, 10 reps of weights and 40 squats. Ermâ€¦. Iâ€™m not sure about that!
