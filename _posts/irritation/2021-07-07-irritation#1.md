To Ellis’ annoyance...<br>
    <br>
    We are now apparently exercising. <br><br>
    Anyone that knows me knows that I do not exercise and have not broken a sweat in almost 9 years. <br>
    This being because I am, when it comes to my physical health, the laziest person I know. Literally. <br>
    <br>
    Well, a slight lie. I do break a sweat regularly, but it's not from exercise it's from doing normal day to do day tasks that shouldn't make me a sweaty mess. Like going to the allotment or helping my baby bro with his flat. Or walking up the stairs. <br>

To anyone that missed it here is a clip from a video I posted back in May 2020 which summarises this exact blog post perfectly.    <br>
        <div style="max-width:600px;min-width:200px;position:relative;margin: 5px auto;"><a class="embedly-card"  data-card-controls="0" href="https://www.facebook.com/ellis.ward.161/videos/1362999067234881"></a><script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><div style="position: absolute;width: 80%;bottom: 7px;left: 0;right: 0;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;color: #000;text-align: center;"><small style="line-height:1.8;font-size:2px;background:#fff;"></small></div></div><br>
 <br>
So, anyway, we’re exercising (I think!)<br>
<br>
We’re 2 days in now and so far I’ve done a few sit up and push ups and then skipped a day <i> already </i>. <br>
    Which kind of would suggest that this is going to go well! <br>
    But I’m going to try, 'cause noone wants to marry a spoil sport, fatty, or quitter.<br>
    So lets see if Yssi and I can end up with trim bods. Anything is possible right?<br>  
<br><br>
I mean, in Yssis beautiful plan (let’s all appreciate her efforts here) we are <i>apparently</i> doing 50 sit ups, 40 push ups, 10 reps of weights and 40 squats. <br>
Erm…. I’m not sure about that! <br>
