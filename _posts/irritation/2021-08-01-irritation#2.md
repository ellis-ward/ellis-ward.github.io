To Ellis’ annoyance...<br>
<br>

Nobody knows you. Like literally at all. 
  And it’s infuriating having to keep going through life over and over and over again trying to let people get to know who you are as a person; 
  repeating conversations constantly. <br>
<br>
You spend your whole life becoming the person you are, building relationships and growing as a person. 
  But people come and go, you start new jobs or move to a new area and it’s constantly like you’re having to start again. 
  There’s so much small talk in this world, but no one actually gets to know you or even listens to the words that are coming out of your mouth. <br>
<br>
Where you come from, your past experiences, accomplishments, likes and dislikes, characteristics and quirkiness and what makes you happy or makes you upset. 
  It’s literally like everyone is happy reading the summary on the back page of your autobiography and that’s ok to make all the judgements about you and then decide if they want to be your friend or not.<br> 
They may then read the highlights or the first paragraph of your chapters, with no care about anything else beyond that. <br>
<br> 
Before I met Yssi, I have spent the last 6 years working in industry and not one single person that I worked with knew I fancied ladies. <br> 
  I mean, to me I think it’s quite obvious and I’ve never hidden it. But literally no one knew. 
  So when I eventually found my life partner and settled down everyone I’d met over the last 6 years were shocked to say the least. 
<br>
I find it so frustrating!<br>
<br>
Like, you start a new job and not one person asks anything about you, they just get to know you from that point onwards. 
  They presume you are and know certain things and aren’t or don’t know other things, but they don’t actually know what you’ve accomplished or failed at previously, who you are beyond work - nor do they care. <br>
<br>
We all have social media now. 
  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and even some of us saddos have blogs. 
  So how come no one takes the time to read through them? Is it just me that does a Facebook and LinkedIn stalk when I meet someone, it must be! <br>
Because I literally make it so open for people to know what I’ve done, who I am and where I’ve come from. 
  Yet I’m still walking through life with only a handful of true friends that I’d trust to plan my funeral, write my biography or even throw a party - 
  and most of them are my family.<br>
<br>
It’s quite sad. It makes you wonder why you even bother trying to please people or make them happy, when realistically they don’t matter and will probably not be in your life in the next 10 years. <br>
<br>
Do I want to make any new friends, make small talk with people or socialise with people I don’t give two tosses about?
