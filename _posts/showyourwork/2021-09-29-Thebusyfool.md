Over the last few years in the Manufacturing Industry I’ve noticed a lot of people making the same mistakes, over and over again. Not<br> necessarily the exact same mistake but the same trend is present for which they are running around being busy fools. Whether it’s with<br> physical hands-on tasks or with computer based tasks there are so many people working in this industry that are running around achieving very<br> little, but are always busy. It’s not like there aren’t a number of books, theories, methodologies that pin this industry that should<br> be making their lives easier! I often think, do they not know what the Toyota Production System is, have they never heard of Henry<br> Ford's Production Line or The New Manufacturing Challenge? Clearly this information, although it should be, is not common knowledge<br> to most people in the Manufacturing Industry; well at least not from what I have seen.<br> 

<h1>Why are so many people extremely busy, but achieving very little?</h1><br>

Honestly, the answer to that question is difficult to underpin, as this doesn’t seem to just be within a specific area of the business, a<br> specific intellect level or even just in the Manufacturing Industry; so there are far too many factors to understand exactly why. However,<br> here are my opinions regardless.
<br>
<h2>Poor management</h2><br>

Realistically there are a lot of people within the Industry that are busy fools because of poor management. They have no time scale to<br> complete tasks, they have no accountability for the tasks and they have little resources to help them succeed. If you don’t give people a time<br> scale to complete their job then the job will go on forever, just think of Parkinson’s Law for this “work will expand to fill the<br> time allotted for its completion”, and let’s be honest we have all been taught that this is acceptable. As long as you get the job done then<br> it doesn’t matter when you completed the work. Who reminders getting an assignment at university or homework at school, I honestly<br> don’t know anyone that got home and completed that work straight away; if you do they are the exception, most people<br> procrastinate until the last minute then get the job done - even my mother did this with her PhD so it’s nothing to be ashamed of. The people<br> who should be ashamed are the managers who don’t know that this theory exists, because if they did they understood that a good<br> manager needs to trust their team enough to manage their own workload but they also need to understand the importance of accountability, goals<br> and support. Good managers understand their team, they understand if they can work autonomously or whether they need support to<br> achieve their tasks. I very rarely see this. Many times what I do see is management letting their team fail, maybe not intentionally, but they<br> are doing. 
<br>
<h2>Poor communication</h2>

A big one that I have found, that as a manager I have tried so hard to not end up in the trap of, is poor communication. If you don’t let your<br> team know what the purpose or goal is then you’re not letting them know the why, which will make the prioritisation of the task not<br> as important and thus they will not focus on it. Tell when what’s going on and why you are driving in the direction you’re driving in.<br> If you’re not a manager then ask, because nothing should be a secret or team work is impossible. 
<br>
<h2>Proactive people and reactive people</h2>

A lot of people are just reactive to the chaos that is life, disaster strikes and they’re constantly fire fighting the react to that disaster;<br> not thinking about the bigger picture, stopping to understand the problem or even taking a breath before speaking out loud. We are all<br> suffering to get to our goals in a reactive fashion, missing the true path that we should be taking. And to be honest I’m just as<br> guilty of this one as the next person. The phrase “follow your last order” always comes to mind when thinking about this topic. I’ve heard<br> this phrase so many times that it’s actually quite frustrating. Now, of course if your last order is the most important and should be at the<br> top of your priority list then absolutely reassess your priorities, but nine times out of ten your last order is a reactive solution<br> to a problem that can wait or it is your boss screaming at your to fix something that they have caused to fail in the first<br> place. Frustrating? Absolutely! 

A proactive approach to solving problems, dealing with situations and managing work loads is not to ask how high every time someone says jump<br> but to ask why. The simple 5 w’s that everyone should know (but either don’t or forget) who, what, when, where, <i>why</i>. Ask them,<br> stop jumping before you know where you’re jumping to and a proactive approach can be taken. This way you understand what is being asked,<br> why it’s being asked and most importantly when it needs to be done. Can it wait until you’ve completed your statistical analysis or does<br> it really need doing this second. If it does that a proactive worker will always stipulate that it will affect the current workload,<br> a proactive worker will also understand that stopping something mid-flow will reduce productivity and in turn will require more<br> concentration to achieve the original goal. 
<br>
<h2>How to be more productive</h2>

Realistically there are lots of ways to be more productive in work but also in day to day life, it’s not about the tips and tricks that others<br> do it’s more about what makes you work better as a person. Do you work better in the morning, evening or the middle of the day? Do<br> you work better with physical to do lists or digital task lists? 
<br>
<h3>Learn to love what you do</h3>

Rather than finding something that you love and earning money from it, you need to learn to enjoy the things that you are doing. Finding<br> something you love that can make you money is not easy, it often needs privilege or circumstances. The easiest way is to start enjoying what<br> you’re doing.

<br>
<h3>You need to stop saying “I have to do this” and start saying “I get to do this” </h3>

Why can’t what you be doing be fun or rewarding? If you have the privilege to live in a developed world where you get to work then you should<br> be thankful for that and not regretful of it. 

<br>
<h3>Stop taking things so seriously</h3>

I very often have to tell myself to stop taking my work so seriously. Realistically it doesn’t matter how many objectives and goals you get<br> given at work, your one and only objective is to make your boss look good. If your boss looks good and they are achieving their goals,<br> which in turn is to make their boss look good, then you are succeeding. Stop worrying about the little unimportant aspects of the day to<br> day and start thinking that your one and only goal is to make sure your boss doesn’t need to chase you, and ultimately if the CEO of<br> the company is drinking their champagne then all is well. 

I often worry about things not being doing “good enough” or that other people are doing things better, but honestly as soon as I remember the<br> above I realise that as long as the company is making money and my boss looks good then it doesn’t matter if the report someone else<br> has produced is not to my standard or production is not as organised as I’d like it to be. Are we making money? Yes. Then breathe and<br> have fun! 
<br>
<h3>To do lists</h3>

To-do lists are brilliant, but I often find myself writing to-do lists and re-writing the same actions on the to-do lists because I haven't<br> completed the task. How do I get around this? At the beginning of the day I write down the top three priorities on a notebook,<br> these are the things I need to get done that day. Every other task I have to do is stored digitally in my digital reminders. For my personal<br> life I use a blackboard in my kitchen for the top priority jobs and everything else lives in my apple reminders. For work I use a<br> notepad for my top priority jobs and everything else lives in my outlook task list. All my digital task lists have reminders associated<br> with them so I get notifications when I absolutely must do the work, but other than that unless it becomes the next priority it<br> sits in my list until it’s required. When you have a to do list that is a page deep then you often get overwhelmed by the list and end<br> up doing nothing because you’re looking at the list going “there’s far too much on this I’ll get to it later” or “I don’t know what to<br> do first so I’ll procrastinate for a bit”. Plus, who has the time to keep writing the same bloody to do list over and over again? I<br> know I don’t. 
<br>
<h3>Priorities</h3>

Realistically the most important aspect of my productivity from day to day is my priority list, I don’t pay much attention to other people's<br> priorities. I focus solely on my own; as I am the one who is making the job get done. I prioritise based on value, time, ease and<br> complexity. I find that the most valuable tasks take the most amount of time and are the most complex to complete, where the least<br> valuable tasks are easy and quick to complete, with very little complexity. Does this mean that smaller tasks are not important? Not at all,<br> it just means that unless a task can be achieved within two minutes then I do not do it right away and it goes into my priority list;<br> based on my criteria. It’s far too easy for someone to ask you to do something or answer a question that they could do themselves or research<br> themselves, because it’s easier to get someone else to do something for you. This is understood, and often respected for the<br> courage to ask, however if you react every time you’re asked to do something you end up being a busy fool. Doing everyone else's job or<br> running around doing a lot to achieve very little. After all, they always say “if you want a job done ask the busy person, there’s a reason they’re busy”. Who’s the fool now? It isn’t the one asking.
