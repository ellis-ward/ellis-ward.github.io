So my mother and I had a call to say that we are now the proud owners of our first ever alloment pitch. We registered for one over just over a year ago, with the intention to have an alloment in time for her retirement. This happened. Literally on the day that she retired she got a phone call from the lady who runs the allotment to say there was one available. <br> 
And of course, we said yes. Who doesn't need another project to add to the thousands already in progress! <br><br>

Before we have even seen the allotment I had already spent 2 hours of my life jamming in my shed listening to some right bangers making us a plaque to put pride of place in our new space. Not that I get carried away or anything.<br><br>

So we went to pick up the key for our brand new allotment. Which turned out to be one of the tidiest and best maintained allotments ever, the previous owner would spend hours picking out all of the tiny weeds and looking after his space with upmost care... Which definitely makes our life easier. We even got some free beans and rhubarb to start us off. Now it's been handed over to two ladies whom have probably the messiest and most disorganised houses in the whole estate. Maybe this could be stretched as far as saying the whole of our City, but that might be a slight exaggeration. <br> Anyway, I digress, I'm sure we will do him proud! <br><br>

In the typical mother daughter spirit we got very ahead of ourselves and started planning sheds and solar panels and discussing all the plants we were going to grow. But we managed to bring ourselves back down to reality, keep it together and only buy Â£35 worth of seeds. For now... <br><br>

All I can say right now is... Let the adventures begin! And I hope whoever, if anyone, is reading this they're ready for a good old crack into the inner workings of my world and have a good laugh at my expense.
